# Facet Public Square

In collaboration with Facet Decision Systems, our goal in this project is to build a system that supports the collaboration and interaction among the different stakeholders when doing oil and gas pipeline planning. Pipeline planning includes a number of activities such as environmental impact analysis, growth and impact modeling, community engagement and many other. Through the system we are currently building, meetings that typically involve anywhere between 25 to 50 stakeholders will be supported using a range of technologies such as vertical displays, tabletops, iPads and iPhones.
